        "\n",
        "In the [MNIST demo](demo_mnist_svm.ipynb), we saw how SVMs can be used for the classic MNIST problem of digit recognition. In this lab, we are going to extend the MNIST dataset by adding a number of non-digit letters and see if the classifier can distinguish the digits from the non-digits. All non-digits will be lumped as a single 11-th class. This is a highly simplified version of 'detection' problem (as opposed to 'classification' problem). Detection is vital in OCR and related problems since the non useful characters must be rejected. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the concepts in the demo, you will learn:\n",
        "* Combine multiple datasets\n",
        "* Select the SVM parameters (`C` and `gamma`) via cross-validation.\n",
        "* Use the `GridSearchCV` method to search for parameters with cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note:  An [earlier version](lab_emnist_2017_partial.ipynb) of this lab made you manually create the combined letter and digit data.  In this lab, we will download the data from NIST website.  But, the old lab is still useful to look at if you want to see how to use `skimage` package for a number of image pre-processing tasks."

In this lab, `GridSearchCV` is not that useful.  But, once you get to more complex parameter searches, the `GridSearchCV` method can save you writing a lot of code.
